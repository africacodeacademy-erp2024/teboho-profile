# Projects

## Overview

This travel booking application was designed to streamline the process of booking travel arrangements and tours. The app aims to provide users with a seamless and convenient experience when planning their trips.

## Technologies Used

- Django
- Bootstrap
- MySql
- Javascript

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was integrating multiple third-party APIs to provide real-time data for bookings. Additionally, ensuring a secure and smooth payment process was critical to the app's success. I addressed these challenges by thoroughly testing API integrations and implementing robust error handling and security measures. I had a really tough time incorporating the booking module in a way that does not look like a typical add to cart module on an ecommerce website.

## Outcomes

The website is still under development and way past the deadline as I am still having trouble safely and accurately adding certain features to the website.

## Future Improvements

To further enhance the app, I plan to add features such as personalized travel recommendations, a loyalty program for frequent users, and integration with additional travel services to provide a more comprehensive booking experience.

## Contributions

I was the lead developer for this project, responsible for designing, coding, and testing the application.
