# Projects

## Overview

This mobile application is designed to teach children the basics of the Sesotho language. It includes lessons on basic words, vowels, and consonants, using interactive activities and quizzes to engage young learners

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Tailwind
- Expo

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was creating engaging and interactive content that could hold the attention of young children. I overcame this by incorporating colorful graphics and gamified learning elements. The other was ensuring linking sounds with images and events, some of the issues that would arise include pressing a button to play a sound only to have the out of sync with the sound playing moments after you pressed the button.

## Outcomes

The app was well-received by parents and educators, with over 100 downloads in the first month. It was praised for its user-friendly interface and effective teaching methods. The graphics still need improvement but overall the reception has been great.

## Future Improvements

I plan to add more advanced lessons and a feature that allows parents to track their childrenâ€™s progress. Additionally, I am considering adding support for other learning methods such as games and puzzles to broaden the app's reach.

## Contributions

I was the lead developer for this project, responsible for designing, coding, and testing the application.
