# About Me

A software engineering graduate with 2 years experience working as a full web developer. Worked for 7 months as an intern, working mostly on front end development, working with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and APIs. Later worked as a freelancer, developing full stack applications using LAMP Stack for small to medium sized businesses.

## Early Life
I grew playing arcade and console games. I played so many games that I eventually took interest in being 
able to create my own. That is where my software engineering journey started. I looked some of the creators 
behind my favourite games such as Tetris, Pacman, Doom, Metalgear Solid and others. Currently looking to work on larger more complex projects that will help me grow and improve my skills as a developer and entrepreneur. Interested in learning and using other modern development technologies for future projects, such as MERN Stack and other related frameworks.
